1. Context Summary (The "Truth" So Far)Project Goal: Build a local analytics engine to track "Growth" and "Curriculum Progression" for ngeShare (a Da'wah platform).The Business Model:Small Groups: Facilitators invite 2-5 members for offline weekly study circles.Curriculum Pipeline: Groups progress through 4 distinct courses (Aqidah $\rightarrow$ Hijrah $\rightarrow$ Sejarah $\rightarrow$ Dakwah).The Architecture:Source: Production PostgreSQL (Read-Only).Destination: Local PostgreSQL (Read/Write).Sync Logic: Incremental sync using updatedAt for most tables; "Window Sync" (last 45 days) for attendance tables lacking timestamps.Key Definitions extracted:"Same Group" Logic: When moving between courses, a group is linked if: (Facilitator is same) AND ( $\ge$ 2 Members are same)."Alumni" Logic: A Facilitator who was previously a Member (based on historical timestamps)."Dropout" vs. "Graduate": Distinguished by whether they stopped before or after hitting the max episode count.
